# RI5CY-Accelerator
This repo consists of a modified RISCY  processor, based on the RV32IMC ISA , which can be used to accelerate ML and AI modules . Currently I have implented a faster DOT Product ,ReLU and Sigmoid activation function mechanism and I am working on other functions which will potentially be used in ML/AI algorithms.
